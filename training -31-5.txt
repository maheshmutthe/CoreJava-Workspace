Binding will happen at compile time Connecting method call to method body is called as Binding!

Acces specifier should be same or stonger((strongest)public->protected-> default-> private)

abstract->

we can not create object of an abstract class

abstract method should also have abstract class

abstract method must be overriden in sub class

abstract method should not have body

if abstract do not override in sub class it should make as abstract method 

we can create a object of child class which constructor present in abstract class.

final->
can be decleare outside or inside a method or block
once decleare value cannot be change

Abstract class and interfaces
-> we cant create object of both.
-> both can have abstract method(from java 8 interfaces can also have body)
-> subclass should override abstact method otherwise make class as abstact

Abstract class vs interfaces
-> we can have constructor in abstrcat class but can't have any interface.
-> abstract class can extend only one class where interface can implement multiple interfaces.
-> identifier decleare in abstract is var and in interface it will be public static final/(const)
