//Observations
//1)  main() will not be accessible to JVM
//2)  at the time of execution JVM does not 
//    consider this new method (without static) as the entry point of the program.
//3)  JVM will not recognize the main() method. Remember JVM always looks for
//    the main() method with a string type array as a parameter.
