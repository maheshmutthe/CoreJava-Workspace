Whatever public class in the file that should be the name of the file
we can have multiple class in a file but only 1 should be public 
& public class file should be name of the file if it presents

in psmv public static is interchangable

we can't declare private & static variable in local var but applicable in class(instance var)


Abstraction -> by Mr. Grady buch
Taking necessary detail from the object as per business(Application) perspective
Counted(completed) while planning before coding


Encapsulation -> 


(Wrapping data Member & Member function in a class)

this ->local varibale will get refered to the current object

static block(not method)-> static block is used to initialize static data member
, static block executes only once.

we can access static member of the class can access in non static & static block
but we can not acces non static member of the class in static block or method

Note -> Why java do not support multiple inheritance.
